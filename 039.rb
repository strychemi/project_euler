# Integer right triangles

=begin

If p is the perimeter of a right angle triangle with integral length sides, {a,b,c}, there are exactly three solutions for p = 120.

{20,48,52}, {24,45,51}, {30,40,50}

For which value of p â‰¤ 1000, is the number of solutions maximised?

=end

=begin
  Brute-force approach was taken here.
  If p = a + b + c and a <= b < c, then a < p/3 and b < p/2.
  So having these upper limits helps reduce computation time.
  Algorithm is still quite slow, but works.

          triplets[perimeter] += 1
